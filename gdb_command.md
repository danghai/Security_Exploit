delete 1		Delete breakpoint 1
disable 1		Disable the breakpoint 1
enable 1		Enable breakpoint 1
delete 			Delete all breakpoints
clear sum (function)	Clear any breakpoints at the entry to function sum
```
### 3. Execution
```
stepi			Execute one instruction
stepi 4			Execute 4 instruction
step			Execute one C statement
continue		Resume execution uuntil the next breakpoint
until 3			Continue executing until program hits breakpointt 3
finish			Resume execution untitil current function returns
call sum(1,2)		Call sum(1,2) and print retsurn value
```

### 4. Examining code
```
disas 			Disassemble current function
disas 	sum		Disassemble function sum
disas   0x80483b7	Disassemble function around 0x80483b7
print /x $rip		Print program counter in hex
print /d $rip		Print program counter in decimal
print /t $rip		Print program counter in binary
```

### 5. Useful information
```
backtrace		Print the current address and stack backtrace
where			Print the current address and stack backtrace
info	program		Print current status of the program
info 	functions 	Print functions in program

```
### 6.Examining data
```
print 0x100		Print decimal representation of 0x100
print /x 555		Print hex representation of 555
print /x ($rsp +8)	Print (contents of %rsp) + 8 in hex
print *(int *) 0xbfff8	Print integer at address 0xbfff8
priint (char *) 0xbff8	Examine a string stored at 0xbff8
x/w 	0xbffff890	Examine (4-byte) word starting at address
x/w 	$rsp		Examine (4-byte) word starting at address in $rsp, print in decimal
x/2w 	$rsp		Examine two (4-byte) word starting at address in $rsp
x/a	$rsp		Examine address in $rsp. Print as offset from previous global
x/s     0xbffff8890	Examine a string stored at 0xbfff8890
x/20b   sum		Examine first 20 opcode bytes of function sum
x/10i 	sum		Examine first 10 instructions of function sum

(Note: the format string for the `x' command has the generall form
	x/[NUM][SIZE][FORMAT] where
NUM    = number of objects to display
SIZE   = size of each object (b = byte, h = half-word, w = word)
FORMAT = how to display each object (d=decimal, x=hex, etc...)  
)
```
