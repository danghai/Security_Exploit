# Security Exploit

Software vulnerabilities are flaws in program logic that can be leveraged by an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a target system. This project include the lab covering both the identification of software vulnerabilities and the techniques attackers use to exploit them. In addition, current techniques that attempt to remediate the threat of software vulnerability exploitation will be dicussed. 

This will be a lab driven class where specific software vulnerability types in particular environments are discussed and then exploited in a lab setting. Examples of lab components of the class as well as specific topics covered include: 

* Shellcode development
* Stack overflow exploitation
* Heap overflow exploitation
* Static source code analysis
* Defeating non-executable stack protection
