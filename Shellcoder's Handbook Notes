# CHAPTER 1:
  * Intruction and Data:
  A modern computer makes no real distinction between instructions and data. If a processor can be fed instructions when it should be seeing
  data, it will go about executing the passed instructions. This characteristic makes system exploitation possible.
  * What happens when a program is execuated?
  First, the OS creates an address space in which the program can run. Next, information is loaded from the program's
  executable file to that space. There are 3 types of segments:
    - .text: is mapped as read-only holding the program instructions
    - .bss: is writable containing uninitialized data
    - .data: is writable containing static initialized data
