# Attack lab

Note: This is the 64-bit successor to the 32-bit Buffer Lab (You can read previous Buffer lab and solution at [here](https://github.com/danghai/Security_Exploit/tree/master/bufbomb)). We are given a pair of unique custom-generated x86-64 binary
executables, called targets, that have buffer overflow bugs. One target is vulnerable to code injection attacks.
The other is vulnerable to return-oriented programming attacks. We are asked to modify the behavior of the targets by developing 
exploits based on either code injection or return-oriented programming. This lab teaches us about the stack discipline and 
teaches them about the danger of writing code that is vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks.

Files:

`ctarget`

Linux binary with code-injection vulnerability.  To be used for phases
1-3 of the assignment.

`rtarget`

Linux binary with return-oriented programming vulnerability.  To be
used for phases 4-5 of the assignment.

`cookie.txt`

Text file containing 4-byte signature required for this lab instance.

`farm.c`

Source code for gadget farm present in this instance of rtarget.  You
can compile (use flag -Og) and disassemble it to look for gadgets.

`hex2raw`

Utility program to generate byte sequences.  See documentation in lab
handout.

There are 5 level in this lab:
