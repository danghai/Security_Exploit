# Bufbomb Lab

Note: This is the legacy 32-bit lab from CS:APP2e. It has been replaced by the Attack Lab. 
In the Buffer Lab, we need to modify the run-time behavior of a 32-bit x86 binary executable by exploiting 
a buffer overflow bug. This lab teaches us about the stack discipline and teaches them about the danger of 
writing code that is vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks. There are 5 phases to do:
