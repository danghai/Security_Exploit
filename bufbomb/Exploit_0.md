# Level 0: Candle
The BUFBOMB program reads a string from standard input. It does so with the function `getbuf`
overrunning the buffer typically causes the program state to be corrupted leading to a memory 
access error. By exploiting this vulnerable memory, we can attack the file to get information 
In particular, in this level, we will exploit and make program run the function `smoke` when
`getbuf` executes its return statement.

Method: providing a enough long string to make getbuf overflow. And then, we can take
control execute program by putting return address on stack memory on EAX register 

## Start: 

1. At the beginning, getting assembly code from execute bufbomb file, and create id cookie
following command:

```
objdump -d bufbomb > assembly.txt
danghai@babbage:~/buflab-handout$ ./makecookie danghai
0x2b9b4cfd
danghai@babbage:~/buflab-handout$ 
```
