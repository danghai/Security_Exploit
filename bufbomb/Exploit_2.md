# Level 2: Firecracker	( Hai Dang )

A much more sophisticated form of buffer attack involves supplying a string that encodes 
actual machine instructions. The exploit string then overwrites the return pointer with the starting address of these instructions
on the stack. When the calling function ( in this case getbuf) executes its ret
instruction, the program will start executing the instructions on the stack rather
than returning. With this form of attack, you can get the program to do almost anything
The code you place on the stack is called the `exploit` code. Specifically, in this
exercise, the goal is:

1. Make buffer overflow (Similarly level 0 and 1), and return register `EIP` to address stack 
2. Inject machine instructions onto the stack ( modify global_value with my cookie)
3. Thos instructions execute and then redirect to function bang()
